	<p>Hello everyone! I just started playing Ark when it came out for free on EGS (Epic Game Store). Ark has been a game that I've been wanting to play for a while but due to being in the military I've had no time to play and I was pretty insecure on starting since I would be a new player and with no one to play. I came across Kara's Server's and I've been playing nonstop ever since! Thanks to Kara and her admins [...] who have taken their time to help me out and expand my ark knowledge. Kara's Servers are by far the best gaming community I've ran into for a while. If you're looking for a place to start your adventure and be part of community that will teach you, this is the place to be!</p>
