	A friend of mine recommended me to play a game called Ark: Survival Evolved. I had heard of it before, but never really played it. So, I started the game up for the first time, and found the hidden gem known as, “Kara’s World”. I got really into the game really quickly, and eventually joined the discord server, where I discovered some of the friendliest people I had ever met. The staff team is well organized, available pretty much 24/7, and is very helpful, (which to me, was very necessary due to me being a new player to the game). In addition to their staff capabilities, they also host regular events on their server such as boosted exp periods, better loot drops, etc. It’s a very fun and interactive server that I have spent a lot of time on. Truly a great experience.
