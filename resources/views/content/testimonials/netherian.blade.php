	I have only been playing on Kara's cluster for a month and during this time I have gotten to know the support team. In my experience they are the best team I have ever encountered within a cluster. They are a small tight-knit group that play the game and understand the problems that arise and needs of us as a community. They handle many support tickets on a daily basis and most often put the needs of the player base above their own. The team engages with the community often whether it be hosting bi-weekly events, resolving technical issues, giving advice or hearing out suggestions in which to better the cluster... I have grown to love this cluster and I think that I have found a place for my survivor to call home.</p>
